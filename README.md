# Detecting Logging Statements for ML usage
This repository represents the work completed by Georgios Nikolopoulos
for his dissertation at UCL. This is work in progress.
## Explanation of Files
### Pip packages.txt
Describes the pip packages that are needed to run the code
### retrieveLogs.py
Main script that retrieves all the logs from the extracted proto files
For now, n order to run it you must edit the contents of main() to point to the correct
folder in your system. Eventually the script will accept params.
### graph_pb2.py
Google's autogenerated library using proto.exe and the graph.proto format. Used in retrieveLogs.py
to parse the proto files.
### /results
Contains both the individual results obtained by running retrieveLogs.py over a single project
as well as running it over all projects (all_projects.json).
### /stats/gatherStats.py
Uses a copy of all_projects.json within the folder to perform statistical analysis of the entire dataset.
### /stats/gatherCorpusStats.py
Uses the /results/individual_results folder to iteratively calculate some statistics for each project.
